Create Framework 2 approaches 
  1- you can create framework by Terminal command without example or with example any.
  2- You can create framework by Xcode -> New-> Framework

Create Pod library Template project by Terminal
$ pod lib create YourLibraryName

Provide the all answers question ask by terminal 


Validation project library by lint command
In side of SDK
 $ pod lib lint

Distribute POD space on Git
Design your pod space at below architecture of folder
Root Folder
  -> SDK name folder  0.1.0
    -> version number
      -> sdk podsapce file
  -> SDK name folder 
    -> version number 0.1.1
      -> sdk podsapce file
  
* Root folder 
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m “your fist commit”
$ git remote add origin ‘Your remote git repertory  path to push your pod space’
$ git push push origin master

Practice 


FWAmarInvestmentSDK
  - use UI screens and rescue as well

FWAmarRechargeSDK
  - follow asset, class structure 

Sample App:
  - using above both sdk


Using SDK in SampleApp when sdk have podspace file
* To use FWAmarRechargeSDK in SampleApp, just provide path of SDK in PDO file, I.e  pod 'FWAmarRechargeSDK', :path => '../FWAmarRechargeSDK'


Using SDK in SampleApp when sdk don’t have podspace file
* If your sdk don’t have pod space file, then drag and drop sdk Xcode project in Sample App, then build sdk and add in SamplePRoject target General-> Framework, Libraries, and Embedded content
* in SDK: provide init method as public for those classes which are going to use from SampleApp

A framework created by Terminal with example, this is only for framework learning purpose. A SKD which provide recharge facilities only.
